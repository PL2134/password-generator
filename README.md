## üé® Design Decisions

### Color Palette
- **Background**: Dark blue-gray (#1F2937) for professional appearance and reduced eye strain
- **Accent Color**: Bright green (#10B981) for buttons, toggles, and generated passwords
- **Text Colors**: White for headings, light gray (#D5D4D8) for labels and descriptions
- **Form Elements**: Dark input backgrounds (#273549) with green text for consistency

### Typography
- **Headings**: Karla font family (800 weight) for bold, modern appearance
- **Body Text**: Inter font family (300-500 weights) for excellent readability
- **Hierarchy**: Clear size and weight distinctions for optimal information architecture

## üîß Code Highlights

### Password Generation Algorithm
```javascript
function generateRandomPassword() {
    let passwordLength = parseInt(lengthInput.value)
    
    // Always include letters for security
    let availableCharacters = [...letterCharacters]
    
    // Add optional character types based on user selection
    if (document.getElementById("include-numbers").checked) {
        availableCharacters = availableCharacters.concat(numberCharacters)
    }
    if (document.getElementById("include-symbols").checked) {
        availableCharacters = availableCharacters.concat(symbolCharacters)
    }
    
    // Generate password character by character
    let password = ""
    for (let i = 0; i < passwordLength; i++) {
        let randomIndex = Math.floor(Math.random() * availableCharacters.length)
        password += availableCharacters[randomIndex]
    }
    return password
}
```

### Modern Clipboard Integration with Fallback
```javascript
function copyToClipboard(text) {
    // Try modern Clipboard API first
    if (navigator.clipboard && navigator.clipboard.writeText) {
        navigator.clipboard.writeText(text)
            .then(() => console.log("Password copied to clipboard!"))
            .catch(() => fallbackCopy(text))
    } else {
        fallbackCopy(text) // Legacy browser support
    }
}
```

### Custom Toggle Switch Implementation
```css
/* Hidden checkbox provides functionality */
.toggle-switch input[type="checkbox"] {
    opacity: 0;
    width: 100%;
    height: 100%;
    position: absolute;
    z-index: 1;
}

/* Visual slider with smooth animations */
.slider {
    background-color: #4a5568;
    border-radius: 24px;
    transition: 0.3s;
}

/* Smooth state transitions */
input:checked + .slider {
    background-color: #10B981;
}

input:checked + .slider:before {
    transform: translateX(26px);
}
```
